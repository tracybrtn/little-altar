        <p>They say all roads lead back to Rome. In the Black branch of the Little Family, all stories lead back to Charity. Born in 1852, she was the daughter of emancipated slaves Tony Jones and Patsy.</p>
        <p>It is unclear how she ended up in Alabama. What we do know is that while she was there in the early 1870s, she mothered three children by white plantation overseer John Little: Lula, Laura, and John. In 1875, while pregnant with John, she left Alabama with her daughters and reunited with her parents in Bowman, SC.</p>
