## Description

React application in the making where coding meets genealogy and art. A site that showcases both my website developer skills and my genealogy research.

### User Story

                As a genealogist-programmer,
                I want to build a strong website
                So that I can pay respect to my ancestors and share their story with the world.

### Acceptance Criteria

                GIVEN a genealogy website
                WHEN I land at the homepage,
                THEN I see a welcoming paragraph, a button to the genealogy page, a footer, and a header
                WHEN I land at the genealogy section, 
                THEN I see the names of different ancestors
                WHEN I click on an ancestor's name,
                THEN their story loads up on my screen
                WHEN I look into the right top corner
                THEN I see a header with an About section
                WHEN I see the footer
                THEN I have the option to checkout the developer's personal portfolio and github
